How to build the RMLOD6:
-copy all files except the gui package
-change PluginInitLOD-> PluginInitLOD6 in multiple files (there will be errors)

-be careful that the version is not exectly the same as for RM 5

-when uploading the jar for the compatibility put the following:
	-for RM5 :blank - 6.0.100
	-for RM6 6.0.100 - blank
- be carefull for operators that want to read the type of the Configurable: GraphImporter (line 210)
